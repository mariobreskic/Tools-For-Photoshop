# Tools-For-Photoshop
Here I am collecting and storing the tools I have added to my Photoshop to improve my workflow.

Tested with Photoshop v22.5.9


If you want to use them yourself, add them to your Script folder inside your Photoshop folder:

Win: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [version]\Presets\Scripts\
Mac: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop [Version]/Presets/Scripts/

Or test them out using the Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit.

Special thanks to the Adobe Community user [c.pfaffenbichler](https://community.adobe.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/7998241) for providing feedback for my v0.0.1 of the Flow scripts.
