# 🛠️ Tools for Photoshop

This repository collects a set of **custom Photoshop scripts** I've created or modified to enhance my workflow. Each tool is designed to streamline common tasks or provide finer control over Photoshop features.

Tested with **Adobe Photoshop v22.5.9**.

## 📦 Installation

To use these scripts in Photoshop, copy them into your Photoshop **Scripts folder**:

- **Windows:**  
  `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [version]\Presets\Scripts\`

- **macOS:**  
  `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts/`

After copying the scripts, restart Photoshop. You’ll then find them under the `File > Scripts` menu.

Alternatively, you can test and run the scripts via the **Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit** (deprecated, but still functional with older Photoshop versions).

## ✨ Features

Current tools include:

- **🔄 Flow Adjustment Scripts**  
  Quickly increase or decrease the **brush flow** in increments, without altering any other brush settings (e.g. scatter, smoothing, texture, etc.).  
  Especially useful when mapped to a **Wacom Ring Menu** or macro device for real-time brush tuning.

- **🎨 Brush Blend Mode Toggle**  
  Instantly switch the **blend mode of the active brush tool** between **Normal** and **Multiply**.  
  Great for digital painting workflows, enabling fast tone control without manually changing settings.

More tools will be added over time as they are developed or refined.

## 🎨 Wacom / Controller Integration

These scripts are optimized for use with external input devices such as:

- **Wacom ExpressKey or Ring Menu**
- **Loupedeck, TourBox, or other macro controllers**

You can bind individual `.jsx` files to input actions for seamless brush control during painting or retouching.
